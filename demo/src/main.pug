      p
        | <span class="first-letter">W</span>eb Typography obsessed me. As many others, 
        | I fell in the trap of optimizing legibility. Definetly not an easy task.
        br
        | Among all the contenders for the best reading experience around the Web, a name is 
        | always present and master (?) of the scene: <strong>Medium.com</strong> .
      p
        | Looking for the arcane secrets that regulates good legibility, I immediately reckon 
        | that I needed to walk in the footsteps of the greatests. So I started dissecting the rules that
        | makes <strong>Medium</strong> typography, well, great.
        br
        | There were long hours of <strong>tremendous effort</strong>, days and days of <strong>prolonged pains</strong>.

        | Now I want to share with you the results of those long hours ü¶ã
      h2 An unexpected journey
      p
        | <span class="first-letter">C</span>omes out that nothing is better than a big first letter to super-charge your style.
        | Rules are simples. A big letter that spans exactly two rows. Play with line-height to get it right.
      h2 The hero
      p
        | When designing a website you have to take into account fonts for three applications: the <strong>content</strong>, the <strong>UI</strong>, the <strong>brand</strong>.
      h2 Content font
      p 
        | The content font should be a serif one, to make our eyes gently brougth from one letter to the other with
        | the lowest amount of effort.
        br
        | Line-height and letter-spacing are vital here. Play with those parameters to make the most out of your
        | font of choice. However at <strong>Medium</strong> you'll find almost an empty line of space in the middle of two lines of text.
        | Letter-spacing is a little bit on the negative side to make words more compacts.
      h2 Brand font
      p 
        | The purpose of this font is to enforce the presence of our brand during the navigation experience.
        | We can use it for titles and, here and there, for some minutiae.
      blockquote Blockquotes, for example ü§´
      h2 UI font
      p 
        | The font used for alle the UI elements is preferably a sans-serif one. It should create contrast with the content font.
        | Its color could be a little bit lighter than the one used for the main content. It needs to be readable given the background-color of your page 
        | but not distracting from the main purpose of the page. <span class="highlighted">Reading!</span>
      h2 <span class="highlighted">The highlight</span>
      p
        | To highlight a word or phrase you can wrap them in a span element and <span class="highlighted">set the background to a color that reminds of your brand color identity</span>.
      h1 Every Title
      p.subtitle `Needs a subtitle`
      p
        | Here we find rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.54) to give meaningful informations without grabbing the attention that the title, main charachter, deserves.
      h2 The length
      p.lineLength 
        | The length of a line of text should never be longer than 740px. So our eyes are not forced to run from left to right on the page. 
      h2 The color
      p 
        | The text color should be rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.84) on a rgba(255, 255, 255, 1) background to ensure the best contrast possible.
      h2 Conclusion
      p
        | As always, the strict first rule of design is that there are no strict rules.
        br
        | But, if you are in trouble...
