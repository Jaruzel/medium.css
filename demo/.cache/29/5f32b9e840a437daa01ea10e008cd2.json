As many others, \n        I fell in the trap of optimizing legibility. Definetly not an easy task.<br>Among all the contenders for the best reading experience around the Web, a name is \n        always present and master (?) of the scene: <strong>Medium.com</strong> .\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Looking for the arcane secrets that regulates good legibility, I immediately reckon \n        that I needed to walk in the footsteps of the greatests. So I started dissecting the rules that\n        makes <strong>Medium</strong> typography, well, great.<br>There were long hours of <strong>tremendous effort</strong>, days and days of <strong>prolonged pains</strong>.\n      </p>\n      <blockquote>Now I want to share with you the results of those long hours ü¶ã</blockquote>\n      <h2>An unexpected journey</h2>\n      <p>\n        <span class=\"first-letter\">C</span>omes out that nothing is better than a big first letter to super-charge your style.\n        Rules are simples. A big letter that spans exactly two rows. Play with line-height to get it right.\n      </p>\n      <h2>The hero</h2>\n      <p>When designing a website you have to take into account fonts for three applications: the <strong>content</strong>, the <strong>UI</strong>, the <strong>brand</strong>.</p>\n      <h2>Content font</h2>\n      <p>\n         The content font should be a serif one, to make our eyes gently brougth from one letter to the other with\n        the lowest amount of effort.<br>Line-height and letter-spacing are vital here. Play with those parameters to make the most out of your\n        font of choice. However at <strong>Medium</strong> you'll find almost an empty line of space in the middle of two lines of text.\n        Letter-spacing is a little bit on the negative side to make words more compacts.\n      </p>\n      <h2>Brand font</h2>\n      <p>\n         The purpose of this font is to enforce the presence of our brand during the navigation experience.\n        We can use it for titles and, here and there, for some minutiae.\n      </p>\n      <blockquote>Blockquotes, for example ü§´</blockquote>\n      <h2>UI font</h2>\n      <p>\n         The font used for alle the UI elements is preferably a sans-serif one. It should create contrast with the content font.\n        Its color could be a little bit lighter than the one used for the main content. It needs to be readable given the background-color of your page \n        but not distracting from the main purpose of the page. <span class=\"highlighted\">Reading!</span>\n      </p>\n      <h2><span class=\"highlighted\">The highlight</span></h2>\n      <p>To highlight a word or phrase you can wrap them in a span element and <span class=\"highlighted\">set the background to a color that reminds of your brand color identity</span>.</p>\n      <h1>Every Title</h1>\n      <p class=\"subtitle\">`Needs a subtitle`</p>\n      <p>Here we find rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.54) to give meaningful informations without grabbing the attention that the title, main charachter, deserves.</p>\n      <h2>The length</h2>\n      <p class=\"lineLength\">\n         The length of a line of text should never be longer than 740px. So our eyes are not forced to run from left to right on the page. </p>\n      <h2>The color</h2>\n      <p>\n         The text color should be rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.84) on a rgba(255, 255, 255, 1) background to ensure the best contrast possible.</p>\n      <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n      <p>As always, the strict first rule of design is that there are no strict rules.<br>But, if you are in trouble... </p>\n      <blockquote>Use Typo.css ‚úçÔ∏è</blockquote><br><br>\n      <p>Let me know what are your toughts about Web Typography, I am eager to hear from you!</p>\n      <p>\n         Happy readings,<br><i>Gez</i></p>\n    </main>\n  </div>\n</body>"},"hash":"7f51ce80a1694f890217fc3cc349eec8","cacheData":{}}
