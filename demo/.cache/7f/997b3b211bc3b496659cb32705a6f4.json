As many others, \n        I fell in the trap of optimizing legibility. Definitly not an easy task.<br>Among all the contenders for the best reading experience on the Web, a name is \n        always present and noteworthy: <strong>Medium.com</strong> .\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Looking for the arcane secrets that regulates good legibility, I immediately realized \n        that I needed to follow in the footsteps of the masters. So I started dissecting the rules that\n        makes <strong>Medium</strong> typography, well, great.\n      </p>\n      <p>There were long hours of <strong>tremendous effort</strong>, days and days of <strong>prolonged pains</strong>...</p>\n      <blockquote>Now I want to share with you the results of those long hours ü¶ã</blockquote>\n      <h2>An unexpected journey</h2>\n      <p>\n        <span class=\"first-letter\">C</span>omes out that nothing is better than a big first letter to super-charge your style.\n        Rules are simples. A big letter that spans exactly two rows. Play with <code>line-height</code> to get it right.\n      </p>\n      <h2>The hero</h2>\n      <p>We all know who the leader is.<br>When designing a website you have to take into account fonts for three sectors: the <strong>content</strong>, the <strong>UI</strong>, the <strong>brand</strong>.<br>Specifically I found that the best free alternatives <i>(Google Fonts)</i> to the handcrafted fonts that <strong>Medium</strong> uses are respectively <span class=\"highlighted\">Lora</span>,\n        <span class=\"highlighted\">Montserrat</span> and <span class=\"highlighted\">Playfair Display</span>. <br>I discovered with delight that the last one mimics almost perfectly the effect created especially for <code>blockquote</code>.\n      </p>\n      <h2>Content font</h2>\n      <p>\n         The content font should be a serif one, to gently bring your eyes from one letter to the other with\n        the lowest amount of effort.<br><code>line-height</code> and <code>letter-spacing</code> are vital here. Play with those parameters to make the most out of your\n        font of choice. However at <strong>Medium</strong> you'll find almost an empty line of space in the middle of two lines of text (<code>line-height: 1.58;</code>).\n        While the space between the charachters is kept a little bit on the negative side (<code>letter-spacing: -0.03;</code>) to make words feel more compacts.\n      </p>\n      <h2>Brand font</h2>\n      <p>\n         The purpose of this font is to enforce the presence of our brand during the navigation experience.\n        We can use it for titles and, here and there, for some minutiae.\n      </p>\n      <blockquote>Blockquotes, for example ü§´</blockquote>\n      <h2>UI font</h2>\n      <p>\n         The font used for all the UI elements is preferably a sans-serif one. It should create contrast with the content font.\n        Its color could be a little bit lighter than the one used for the main content. <br>It needs to be readable given the background-color of your page \n        but not distracting from the main purpose of the page. <span class=\"highlighted\">Reading!</span><br>You can use it also for <code>h2</code> making the titles for your paragraphs. Here the color should be the same as the one used for the main title.\n      </p>\n      <h2><span class=\"highlighted\">The highlight</span></h2>\n      <p>To highlight a word or phrase you can wrap them in a <code>span</code> element and <span class=\"highlighted\">set the background to a color that reminds of your brand color identity</span>.</p>\n      <h1>Every Title</h1>\n      <p class=\"subtitle\">`Needs a subtitle`</p>\n      <p>Here we find <code>rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.54)</code> to give meaningful informations without grabbing the attention that the title, main charachter, deserves.</p>\n      <h2>The length</h2>\n      <p class=\"lineLength\">\n         The length of a line of text should never be longer than <code>740px</code>. So our eyes are not forced to run from left to right on the page. </p>\n      <h2>The color</h2>\n      <p>\n         The text color should be <code>rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.84)</code> on a <code>rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)</code> background to ensure the best contrast possible.</p>\n      <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n      <p>As always, the strict first rule of design is that there are no strict rules.<br>But, if you are in trouble... </p>\n      <blockquote>Use Typo.css ‚úçÔ∏è</blockquote><br><br>\n      <p>Let me know what are your toughts about Web Typography, I am eager to hear from you!</p>\n      <p>\n         Happy readings,<br><i><a href=\"https://codepen.com/lucagez\">Gez</a></i></p>\n    </main>\n  </div>\n</body>"},"hash":"895eac2005a7172b10d61311b44bad15","cacheData":{}}
